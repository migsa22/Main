## Question: 
SImplify the mechanism of how a transformer model works

Answer (ChatGPT): 
Tokenization:

Break down the input data into tokens, which can be words, subwords, or any meaningful units.
Embedding:

Convert the tokens into vectors by embedding them. Each token gets a unique vector representation.
Training:

Train a neural network using the embedded data. The network learns the relationships between tokens in a high-dimensional space through attention mechanisms and self-attention mechanisms.
Learned Weights:

The trained model assigns weights to the relationships between tokens. These learned weights capture the contextual dependencies and relationships in the data.
Inference:

Use the trained model to process new data. The model embeds the new tokens and leverages the learned weights to understand their relationships with the training data, allowing for tasks like predictions and classifications in the high-dimensional space.
Your explanation effectively conveys the fundamental steps in how transformers learn and how the learned knowledge is applied to new data. It might be beneficial to briefly mention the attention mechanism, as it plays a crucial role in capturing dependencies between tokens during training. Additionally, noting that the transformer's self-attention allows it to consider the entire context of a sequence is a valuable point to include in presentations.
